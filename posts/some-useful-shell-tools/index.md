Here are some shell tools I use, which can boost your productivity.

### [Prezto](https://github.com/sorin-ionescu/prezto)

A zsh configuration framework. Provides auto completion, prompt thems and lots of modules to work with other useful tools. I exremely love the `agnoster` theme.

### [Fasd](https://github.com/clvv/fasd)

Help you to navigate between folders and launch application.

Here are the official usage example:
```
  v def conf       =>     vim /some/awkward/path/to/type/default.conf
  j abc            =>     cd /hell/of/a/awkward/path/to/get/to/abcdef
  m movie          =>     mplayer /whatever/whatever/whatever/awesome_movie.mp4
  o eng paper      =>     xdg-open /you/dont/remember/where/english_paper.pdf
  vim `f rc lo`    =>     vim /etc/rc.local
  vim `f rc conf`  =>     vim /etc/rc.conf
```
